# Task: Implement Fading Image Slideshow in Welcome Section

Please update the `welcome` section by implementing a CSS-only image slideshow within the **child element of `.welcome__hero`**.

## Requirements

- **Effect**: Create an automatic image slideshow where images transition using a **fade-in and fade-out** animation.
- **Animation Cycle**: The animation must follow a precise 4-second cycle for each image:
    - An image should be fully visible for **3 seconds**.
    - The fade transition to the next image should last **1 second**.
- **Assets**: Source all images from the `assets/welcome/heros/` directory.
- **Technology**: The implementation must use **only HTML and CSS**.
- **Constraint**: It is critical that **no code outside of the `welcome` section is modified**.
